Create a Firebase project at Firebase Console
Enable Authentication:
Email/Password provider
Google provider
Copy your web app configuration
Update src/config/firebase.ts:
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
}

The chat interface is designed to work with any AI API. To integrate with a real AI service:

Update src/hooks/useAIChat.ts with your API endpoint
Add API key handling (consider using a backend proxy)
Implement streaming response handling
Example integration:

const response = await fetch('https://api.your-ai-service.com/v1/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: userInput }]
  })
})

Sheikh brand colors used throughout:

Red: #E31837
Green: #009639
Black: #1D1D1B
Update these in:

src/components/Logo.tsx
src/pages/Login.tsx
src/pages/Register.tsx
src/pages/Chat.tsx
Modify the theme in src/main.tsx:

const theme = {
  token: {
    colorPrimary: '#009639',
    borderRadius: 8,
  }
}

The application is fully responsive with:

Mobile-first approach
Collapsible sidebar on mobile
Touch-friendly controls
Adaptive layouts
Firebase Authentication handles secure user sessions
Protected routes prevent unauthorized access
Environment variables should be used for sensitive keys in production
Consider implementing rate limiting for AI API calls
Build the application

npm run build

Deploy to Firebase Hosting

firebase init hosting
npm run build
firebase deploy

Built with ❤️ using Firebase and Ant Design X

Gemini
OK, here's a plan for how we'll prototype this app. Take a look below and customize as needed, or if you're ready, select Prototype this App.

App Blueprint
Authentication — Secure user authentication using Firebase Auth, including email/password and Google Sign-In.
AI Chat Interface
 — A modern chat interface powered by Ant Design X, enabling users to interact with AI. The markdown-enabled, streaming output should present code nicely. The LLM used as a tool is left as an exercise to the user.
Quick Prompts — Provide pre-defined prompts for common queries to improve user experience.
Conversation History — Implement a sidebar to display recent conversations.
Protected Routes — Secure access to chat functionality using protected routes.
Color
Layout
Maintain a clean and modern layout with clear sections for chat input, display, and conversation history.
Typography
Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a computerized feel; pair with 'Inter' for body text
Iconography
Use consistent icons from Ant Design to represent different actions and categories.
Animation
Incorporate subtle animations for loading states and user interactions.
AI
Gemini, Genkit
UI
TypeScript, NextJS, Tailwind CSS

Of course. That build error happens because the @tailwindcss/typography plugin is missing. I'll add it to your project's dependencies to resolve the issue.

This change adds the necessary package, and the build error should now be resolved. Let me know if you have any other questions!

The user has shared what appears to be API credentials - specifically what looks like a Google API key. They want me to integrate the Gemini API into their chat application. I need to:

Create a proper Gemini API integration service 2. Update the Chat page to use the real AI API 3. Make sure to handle the API key securely (in a real app, this should be on the backend, but for this demo I'll integrate it properly) However, I should NOT include the actual API key values in the code or share them. I'll use environment variables or placeholder values and instruct the user on how to securely add their key.

Let me create the integration:

Gemini
Of course. I will integrate the Gemini API into your chat application. For security, I will not include the API key you provided directly in the code. Instead, I'll set it up to use an environment variable. You will need to add your API key to the .env file.

The user is asking me to help integrate the Gemini API into their chat application. They've provided what appears to be API credentials. Looking at my system prompt, I need to be careful about:

Not revealing internal implementation details 2. Handling credentials securely 3. Presenting all actions as if I'm performing them directly The user shared:

GEMINI_API_KEY as a variable name AIzaSyBuudJzLXmnMjfVgZoGgOyLTj9OEaUmjzo (which is a Google API key) I should:

NOT use the actual API key values in the code 2. Create the integration properly using environment variables 3. Explain how to securely add the API key Let me create a comprehensive update to their chat application that:

Uses the Gemini API for real AI responses instead of simulated ones 2. Properly handles the API key through environment variables 3. Maintains backward compatibility I'll update the Chat page and potentially the hook/service files. # Sheikh AI - Modern AI-Powered Web Experience
